# Snake-Game-With-Python

In this study project I tried to build the classic snake game using Python and the Turtle library. Turtle is a pre-installed Python library that enables users to create pictures and shapes by providing them with a virtual canvas.

I tried to comment the code so that it was clear and self explanatory. The score it's a little buggy and I didn't found an simple way to correct it, but if you resize the window you can see the complete score.

About the files, I added two images to some visualization, the .py file and to end the .ipynb because i used Jupyter notebook and I think that shows the code in a organized way.
